          <h2>Why wouldn't you trust your bartender to develop your website?</h2>

          <p>You laugh. I laugh. We laugh together. And then I give you that Clint Eastwood Spagetti Western stare because I'm serious like a heart attack.</p>
          <p>Bartenders rely on visual acumen to craft a cocktail that is aesthetically pleasing, because people "taste" with their eyes, too. They know how to follow directions to produce consistent results time and time again. But they also know how to check their work and tweak a thing to get it to be the way it should be. Bartenders also have people smarts. They know how to adapt their communication style to best serve the client in front of them. And they don't mince their words. You can always count on a bartender to be forthcoming. Our work lives get busy. We don't have time for nonsense.</p>
          <p>So unless you <em>aren't</em> looking for a creative, expedient, analytical individual with insanely good people skills, you should consider a bartender for your next web project.</p>

              <p>This is a blog site. It is not a very active blog. It might get more active. I'm going to write a bunch of words here because I'm about to try something out and I need a bunch of text to do it. Also I am terrible at using the dummy text generators. I am sure I will get better at that at some point, or maybe I won't. Who knows? There is a lot left to learn that only the future will reveal in its time. Ok let's see if this is enough words.</p>
